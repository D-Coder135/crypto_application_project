# Crypto Crux ðŸ¤‘

## My Goal

The objective of this project was to build an application that fetches the live rates of various Crypto-Currencies (in USD and INR both) using an API Call. The application also has a subscribe and unsubscribe functionality by which a user can add/remove crypto-currencies in which he/she is intrested, from the Homepage of the app. The application uses the online Google's Firebase Authentication and Firestore Database for authenticating its users and storing the data for each user separately. Hence providing a beautiful user interface depending on the platform i.e. Android or iOS.

## What I have created

A Crypto-Currency price checking app which will be able to monitor your bitcoin investents on the move!
